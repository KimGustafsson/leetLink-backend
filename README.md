# leetLink-backend
Backend part of the leetLink url shortener service

## Note
As of now the backend isn't really needed to run the leetLink project because i have set up the backend on aws. This means that you can just run the frontend and start playing :) yey

## How to run
1. Install nodemon from npm : npm i -g nodemon
2. Set up mongoDB
3. run "nodemon app.js" in the project directory
4. Go start up the frontend
5. Start generating some short urls! Yey
